      <p>Hi, I am Jonathan Chow, welcome to my mobile-responsive portfolio page! I am currently learning coding from the UofT SCS Coding Bootcamp to equip myself with the neccessary tools to make the career jump into the field of technology.</p>
      
      <p>Since graduating from McMaster University with a Bachelor of Commerce, I have been mainly working in finance and accounting but I believe now is the right time for me to jump into web development as it has always been something I am passionate about. I hope that the knowledge I gain from this course will enable me to combine my love and passion for investing and trading with my passion for coding and creating. </p>
